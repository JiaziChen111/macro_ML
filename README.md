## Macroeconomic Analysis with Machine Learning and Big Data

### What's New?

**Aug 21:** I am revising all the remaining notes of this course and plan to upload them to [lecture notes](https://github.com/yangycpku/macro_ML/tree/master/Notes) page in a few days.

**July 18:** The [lecture notes](https://github.com/yangycpku/macro_ML/tree/master/Notes) on Structural Model in Macroeconomics (I) taken by @刘舸帆 and @袁锡林 have been uploaded. The notes on Statistical Model (II) will be uploaded a bit later.

**July 10:** We will have Dr. [Jiequn Han](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~jiequnh/) to teach a guest lecture on Mean Field Games (MFG) and Heterogeneous Agent Model in Continuous Time (HACT) on July 18.

**July 10:** The [lecture notes](https://github.com/yangycpku/macro_ML/tree/master/Notes) on Statistical Model in Macroeconomics (I) taken by @胡裕民 and @杨路 have been uploaded.

**July 8:** Instructions for the final project have been uploaded [here](https://github.com/yangycpku/macro_ML/blob/master/Final%20Project/Final%20Project.md).

**July 5:** The [lecture notes](https://github.com/yangycpku/macro_ML/tree/master/Notes) on unsupervised learning taken by @黄冠华 have been uploaded. 

**July 4:** The presentation schedule has been uploaded [here](https://github.com/yangycpku/macro_ML/blob/master/Presentation%20Schedule.md). Please refer to the slides of the first lecture for instructions. You can find a sample presentation [here](https://github.com/yangycpku/macro_ML/blob/master/Presentation/sample_slides.pdf), but please note that it was a 15-minute presentation. A 30-minute presentation would have about 20 pages of slides.

**July 4:** The [lecture notes](https://github.com/yangycpku/macro_ML/tree/master/Notes) this morning taken by @黄冠华 and @郑重 have been uploaded.

### Course Description

We introduce emerging opportunities in macroeconomics due to the recent booming of big data and the development of machine learning. We will systematically discuss relevant existing work (e.g. state space models, heterogeneous agent models, reduced-form macro models) and a series of recent work. The course will be based on lecture notes by instructors and relevant papers.
